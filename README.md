## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to add multiple background images to a single element along with a background color. I also learnt how to position multiple background images on a single element individually.

### Continued development

During the task of completing this challenge I tried using CSS Grid for my layout and had difficulty using this property along with other associated properties and I would continue learning and experimenting with the grid property as I am not fully proficient with using it.

### Useful resources

- I haven't used any resources during this challenge and only used the skills and concepts I am fimiliar with, though I did try using CSS Grid and reverted to flexbox when I faced difficulty.
